              I had just heard that a young man in my community had decided to
              take his own life. As I was sitting in the backyard watching my
              son play and feeling a tiny piece of how hard it would be to lose
              a child, I decided I would write a song to give to the family. We
              hope you enjoy.{" "}

              I still remember the day of our marriage and still not knowing
              what song I was going to sing at our reception that evening. I was
              playing around with a few options, such as an original or other
              covers I could play. Nina knew this and as I was showing her some
              options, she was very confident when she chose this one. As a
              smart man I agreed and played this song for her. It goes without
              saying that this song is special to us. I still remember seeing
              her in a dark room at a dance and being mezmorized by her big
              beautiful eyes that I could see from across the room.{" "}

              A week before Christmas in 2018 I was sitting in a rocking chair
              in my daughterâ€™s room with my guitar. My family had left ahead of
              me to travel from Utah to California to visit family while I
              finished school. I was thinking about them and how much love I had
              for them and the fact that we had a new baby on the way. With
              every child I have taken the time to write them a song and turned
              my thoughts to my new nephew Aiden. I picked some chords and
              started jotting down the lyrics in my phone. This one came very
              easily and I would say from the start of the writing process to
              the end was right around 40 minutes. I love the joy that comes
              from a new life entering the world and this song really is in
              honor of those sweet spirits coming down.
